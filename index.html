					<h3 class="overview">Overview</h4>
					<p>Rangers are the middle-ranged specialist attackers. They can deal impressive single target damage on foes by focusing on their weak spots, 
						and provide covering fire by clearing trash mobs with explosives. Their biggest asset, Weak Bullet (WB), provides a massive damage enhancement that can quickly destroy bosses, if aimed right.
                                                If you spot something that is incorrect, send a Pull Request. If you don't know what that is,
						then I guess it's not being corrected now isn't it?</p>

						<h3>Weapon Overview</h3>
						<p>
							The weapons used by Ranger are the Assault Rifle and Launcher.
                                                        Assualt Rifles are the middle-ranged, single target weapon, with noticeable charge times on their 2 powerful PAs that can quickly take down threats before they move. 
                                                        Rifle provides options for other situations as well like mobbing, but it’s not as strong as the Ranger’s secondary. 
                                                        Launchers are the short ranged, AoE weapon that requires good positioning and aim to make the most out of their slow PAs. 
                                                        If done right however, Launchers will decimate mobs with ease. 						
						</p>
						<p>This section will cover and offer a brief explanation of the weapons of Hero.</p>

									<td>Ranger's main bossing tool with a selection of tools for different enemy sizes. 
                                                                            The main feat this weapon brings is powerhouse Photon Arts such as End Attraction and Satellite Cannon. 
                                                                            It also has good sustain PAs like Parallel Slider-0 and Homing Emission for more mobile targets.    </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/LauncherSmall.png" alt="launcher icon" width="16px"></td>
									<td>Launcher</td>
									<td>Absolutely a pocket nuke with some of the best mobbing capability in the game! 
                                                                            Launcher is slower but with precision and precasting your PAs you can demolish enemies immediately on spawn or soon after.
									    Mowing down spawns with Sphere Eraser, dunking heads with Rodeo Drive-0 or sending bodies flying with Divine Launcher-0 can be quite addicting, 
									    just ask Fourier

						<h3>Photon Arts</h3>
						<p>This section will list the relevant PAs on their placement as a Ranger.</p>
						<h4>Rifle Photon Arts</h4>
						<table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
									<th scope="col" style="width:150px">Photon Art</th>
									<th scope="col">Description</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/UIPhotonArtEndAttract.png"></td>
									<td>End Attraction</td>
									<td>A charged PA that deals huge amounts of damage, this is your main PA when you can’t use Satellite Cannon. 
                                                                            However, it shares the same flaws with Satellite Cannon in that it has a limited range, and roots you in place while charging.
                                                                            Aiming End Attract is very important; in the right position, you can hit weak spots on enemies multiple times..</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/UIPhotonArtSatelliteCannon.png"></td>
									<td>Satellite Cannon</td>
									<td>Quite literally a laser from the sky that rains damage upon a single position. A bit of a lengty charge similar to End Attract
                                                                            with a better use against humanoid bosses like Flame Diamos or tiny weakpoints like Zeshrayda when toppled over. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/UIPhotonArtHomingEmission.png"></td>
									<td>Homing Emission & Type-0</td>
									<td>The vanilla version requires manual aiming to lock on (up to) 6 targets,
                                                                            which can be very tedious and impractical given what boss you're up against. Type-0 fires all 6 shots and has less PP cost, making its average damage output higher than vanilla.
                                                                            It's your fastest PA used for Standing Snipe filler so best to get comfortable with it. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/UIPhotonArtParallelSlider.png"></td>
									<td>Parallel Slider & Type-0</td>
									<td>Has i-frames on the twirl start up when crafted, quite useless vanilla due to type-0 having susatinability and movement.
                                                                            One of more favored PAs when soloing bosses to deal damage on the go and set up Standing Snipe with i-frames.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td>
									<td>Sword Normals</td>
									<td>Not exactly a PA, but boy does it do as much as if you were using a PA.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td>
									<td>Aura (Sword Weapon Action)</td>
									<td>Not a PA either, but worth mentioning. Using your weapon action with sword lets you fire a stream of small bursts
										of photons. Can be used to regen PP. Combine with a macro to tap shift continously and you can be a lazy ass too!
										After unlocking and putting points into Aura High Charge on the tree, you can long press the weapon action to
										charge up and fire a massive blast of energy.</td>

						<h3>MLG Strats</h3>
						<p>General idea is to alternate weapons to generate max gear. Once gear is maxed, you can choose to pop hero time and
						use Moment Trick twice to generate the maximum hits needed for Hero Time, and swap to Sword to ramp up the damage before gear gauge runs out and finishing with
						Hero Time Sword.</p>
